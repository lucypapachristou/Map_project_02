        <p>NEW YORK—New data from the International Organization for Migration shows that about a quarter of all migrants and refugees in Bosnia are living outside official camps, although there are thousands of empty beds available.</p>
        <p>The International Organization for Migration (IOM) <a href="https://migration.iom.int/europe/migrants-presence">estimates</a> there to be just under 2,900 migrants in Bosnia as of mid-December. While around 2,300 are in temporary reception centres (TRCs), or camps, roughly 580 people live outside official structures, squatting abandoned houses, sleeping rough in tents in the forests, or in private rentals. There are over 2,000 unfilled beds in Bosnia’s five refugee camps.</p>

        <p>Bosnia lies along the so-called “Balkan Route” of migration and has seen thousands of migrants and refugees pass through on their way to Western Europe since 2017, when Hungary installed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-hungary-fence/hungary-builds-new-high-tech-border-fence-with-few-migrants-in-sight-idUSKBN1692MH">high-tech wall</a> on its border with Serbia, effectively shutting down that route.</p>
        <p>The majority of those outside camps (449 people) are in the northwest Una Sana region, where migrants gather to cross the border into EU-member state Croatia. IOM has also identified migrant populations in Sarajevo, in the eastern city of Tuzla, and in Mostar in the southwest.</p>
        <p>Bosnia has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years for the conditions inside its refugee camps, as rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/01/21/bosnia-and-herzegovina-migrants-left-cold">decry<a/> the lack of basic services such as adequate heating, hot water, and proper sewage treatment.</p>

        <p>“Inside the camp were bad things,” says Imran, 38, a Pakistani migrant who lived in Miral camp in Velika Kladuša last year. “It was wintertime and there was no warm water. There were only 18 showers. Imagine, one thousand people living like this.”</p>
        <p>Imran spoke on the phone from Italy; He arrived there two months ago and hopes to find work to support his young son, looked after by his parents back in Pakistan. He asked that his real name not be revealed because he is undocumented in Italy.</p>
        <p>Imran found Miral camp so bad that he chose to leave in the summer of 2020 and spent over a year living in an abandoned house with dozens of other Pakistani men a few hundred meters from the facility. Life was hard in the unheated house, but he says he never regretted his decision to leave the camp.</p>
        <p>“Outside was better. We had open air, we could move, go to the supermarket, cook what we wanted. We could easily try to cross the border,” he explains. “Outside is a dirty place, but inside is also a dirty place.”</p>
        <p>A poor country with a weak federal government, Bosnia has struggled to handle the number of migrants transiting through the country.</p>
        <p>Last December, Lipa camp in the northwest’s Una Sana region <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1080852">burned to the ground</a>, leaving over a thousand people stranded without shelter in the snow for days as authorities scrambled to find alternative accommodation.</p>
        <p>The camp was <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/bosnia-migrants-lipa/31570647.html">rebuilt</a> this year with EU funds and a capacity for 1,500 people. But this month, it is housing only 312 people, while an estimated 200-250 migrants are living in Bihać, the nearby regional capital. Lipa is located in a remote area with few services and lacks reliable public transportation to Bihać or other parts of Bosnia.</p>
        <p>To Imran, who lived in Miral for a year, it comes as no surprise that migrants would prefer to live outside camps.</p>
        <p>“[The camp] was a very bad place,” he says from the Italian refugee camp where he is awaiting work authorization documents. “The water was running all over because the tap was broken. No one came to fix the toilets and it was smelling all the time. The blankets were never cleaned.”</p>
        <p>Ultimately, though, advocates say the responsibility for migrants’ plight does not lie solely with the Bosnian government.</p>
        <p>“The EU’s responsibility is clear – the current humanitarian crisis is also a consequence of EU’s policy of fortifying its borders that has left thousands of people stranded on its periphery or in the neighbouring countries,” Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/01/bosnia-and-herzegovina-long-term-solutions-needed-to-end-recurring-humanitarian-crisis/">said</a> this January.</p>
        <p>“The EU must create more genuine opportunities for safe and legal ways for those fleeing conflict, persecution or poverty to reach Europe,” she continued.</p>
